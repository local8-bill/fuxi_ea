# 🧠 Fuxi_EA v0.6.4 — HAT Baseline (Human Acceptance Testing)

**Tag:** `v0.6.4-hat-baseline`
**Date:** 2025-12-02

---

### ✅ Highlights

- **End-to-end project flow verified:**
  - Project creation → Intake → Tech Stack → Ecosystem now fully functional.
  - Middleware enforces sequential navigation and gating.

- **Harmonization pipeline stabilized:**
  - Single or dual CSV ingestion works reliably.
  - Fuzzy dependency resolver connects upstream/downstream with confidence scoring.
  - Domain overlays sync cleanly with harmonized data.

- **Timeline integration complete:**
  - Slider interactions emit `timeline_stage_changed` telemetry.
  - No blank graph states — always shows valid architecture.

- **Telemetry coverage expanded:**
  - Captures upload, harmonization, graph load, and timeline events with session metadata.
  - Events persisted locally in `.fuxi/data/telemetry_events.ndjson`.

- **Graph rendering (ReactFlow baseline):**
  - Improved readability with fit-to-space, domain columns, and edge color coding (🟦 derived / 🟪 inferred / 🟧 unresolved).
  - Verified performance ≤1.5s render for 200 nodes / 500 edges.

### 🧩 Technical

- **Feature branch:** `feat/d043a_timeline_hooks`
- **Verification Dashboard:** updated with HAT outcomes
- **Known follow-ups:**
  - D044 → Cytoscape visual upgrade
  - D045 → ROI Modeling foundation
