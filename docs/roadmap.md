# Fuxi Capability Intelligence — Roadmap (Draft v1)

## 1. Industry-Aware Capability Baselines
Purpose: preload industry capability standards to help users compare and tune their capability maps.

Deliverables:
- Project setup industry selector
- Industry reference JSON assets
- AI reasoning upgraded to use industry context
- UX affordance to compare with industry baseline

## 2. Capability Restructuring UI
Purpose: allow users to reorganize L1–L3 structures safely and visually.

Deliverables:
- Drag & drop tree editor
- Domain reassignment
- Promote/demote capability levels
- Safe-commit diff + undo workflow

## 3. Holistic “Capability Atlas” (No Scoring Mode)
Purpose: provide a clean, enterprise-wide map view.

Deliverables:
- `/project/{id}/capability-atlas` page
- Hierarchy-only view
- Visual domain coloring
- Download/export options
- Optional AI summaries

## 4. Visual Map Extraction
Purpose: convert images/pdfs/ppts of capability maps into structured L1–L3 hierarchies.

Deliverables:
- OCR + layout detection
- Hierarchy inference
- AI recomposition + domain suggestions
- Confidence indicators

## 5. Digital Twin Expansion
Purpose: connect capabilities → processes → apps → people → data.

Deliverables:
- Layered model support
- Reasoning across layers
- Impact analysis (change, investment, consolidation)

## Recommended Sequence
Phase 2:
- Industry baselines
- Restructuring UI
- Atlas mode

Phase 3:
- Visual map extraction
- Digital twin layers
