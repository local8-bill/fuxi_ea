# Fuxi Strategic Flow Blueprint v2
### *Architect Mode — Internal Baseline Document*

---

## 1. Establish Strategic Intent
Every architecture begins with intent — the pattern the enterprise wishes to take shape.  
Fuxi interprets the declared strategy into its structural equivalents: capabilities, domains, and value chains.

- **Input:** Vision statements, transformation goals, market theses  
- **Output:** Initial capability hypothesis map  
- **AI suggests:** Capability candidates derived from comparable industries and goals.  
  > “Reduce operational drag and expand DTC reach” → *Engage Consumers, Product Innovation, Order Fulfillment, Customer Experience*

---

## 2. Define or Import a Capability Map
The enterprise may construct, import, or visually extract its capability model.

- **Vision module:** Reads diagrams or PDFs to recover L1 / L2 / L3 hierarchies.  
- **Auto-mapping:** Aligns uploaded items to reference taxonomies.  
- **Human oversight:** Architects validate, merge, and label.  

Result: a normalized capability landscape ready for analysis.

---

## 3. Assess Current and Future State
Capabilities are evaluated across business, technology, and operational maturity dimensions.

- **Dimensions:** Performance, resourcing, governance, sponsorship, talent  
- **Reference:** *Priority Capability Resource Model* (Business / Tech Resources, Opex, Capex, Core Competences, Governance, Alignment, Engagement)  
- **AI suggests:** Probable maturity tiers inferred from supporting data.  
  > “PLM Software + moderate sponsorship” → likely Maturity Level 3

---

## 4. Surface Opportunities and Gaps
When the present collides with the intended, opportunity emerges.

- **Lenses:** Efficiency (Opex/Capex imbalance), competence vs utilization, tech alignment, governance tension  
- **AI suggests:** Composite “opportunity hotspots” with reasoning chains explaining each anomaly.

---

## 5. Apply Thematic Overlays
Strategic themes — sustainability, digitalization, customer centricity, risk resilience — form meta-layers atop the base map.

- **AI suggests:** Re-weighted priorities showing multi-theme impact.  
  > Sustainability overlay → elevates *Supply Chain Transparency* and *Energy Efficiency in PLM*.

---

## 6. Integrate Technology Stack and Portfolio
Capabilities gain realism through linkage to the actual technology estate.

- **Input:** Application and platform inventory  
- **AI suggests:** Redundancy and fragility patterns  
  > “Two CRM platforms cover identical functions under Customer Care.”  
- **Outputs:** A clear *Capability ↔ Application ↔ Spend* matrix.

---

## 7. Generate the Roadmap
With dependencies and priorities known, Fuxi orchestrates scenario-based roadmaps.

- Quick wins  ·  Foundational enablers  ·  High-leverage initiatives  ·  Investment streams  
- **AI suggests:** Optimal sequencing under different constraints.  
  > “Advance PLM modernization before supply planning to unlock forecast automation.”

---

## 8. Validate with Evidence
Every recommendation is traceable to its supporting data.

- **Evidence Log:** Captures metrics, system signals, and human inputs behind each decision.  
- **AI suggests:** Confidence and counter-evidence scores for governance review.

---

## 9. Align People and Roles
Structure follows purpose.

- **Input:** Org roles, team boundaries, skills data  
- **AI suggests:** Realignment options where capability ownership is fragmented.  
  > “Demand Forecasting spans three teams → consider unification under a single product owner.”

---

## 10. Fuxi Strength Check (Meta Layer)
The final scan tests architectural coherence:

- Capabilities align to strategic intent  
- Technology supports critical path  
- Governance and roles cover each node  
- No orphaned or circular dependencies  

A Fuxi-strong model is logically sound, strategically defensible, and fundable.

### AI Enhancement Matrix

| EA Task | Traditional Effort | AI suggests adds |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|
| Capability Identification | Manual re-entry from slides | Vision & text recognition |
| Taxonomy Alignment | Spreadsheet reconciliation | Auto-mapping with confidence scores |
| Maturity Assessment | Surveys + subjectivity | Contextual reasoning from inputs |
| Opportunity Discovery | Heatmaps by hand | Composite scoring with thematic filters |
| Roadmapping | Linear timelines | Dependency-aware scenario synthesis |
| Evidence Tracking | Untraceable slides | Explainable reasoning chains |

---

### Fuxi Architecture Layers

1. **Rationalization Core** – capability ingestion & scoring  
2. **Opportunity Lens Framework** – lenses for gap and priority analysis  
3. **Thematic Overlays** – multi-dimension scoring logic  
4. **Prioritization & Roadmapping Engine** – scenario simulation  
5. **Evidence & Governance Layer** – explainability and traceability  

---

### Next Moves

1. **Lock this blueprint as baseline** in the EA Playbook folder.  
2. Build the first *AI Suggests* functions (vision parser + opportunity lens API).  
3. Extend the Resource Model from your spreadsheet to feed capability scoring.  
4. Begin UI concept sketches for Steps 3–5 (current/future state → opportunity → overlay).
