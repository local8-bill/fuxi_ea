## 🧩 Directive D085D – Organizational Readiness Index Report

### 🎯 Objective

Define and implement the **Organizational Readiness Index (ORI)** — a dynamic intelligence report that measures an enterprise’s preparedness for transformation. This report complements the Organizational Alignment Index (D085C) by focusing on *execution readiness* — how capable, agile, and resilient the organization is to act on its strategic decisions.

---

### 🧠 Concept Overview

The ORI quantifies readiness across three key dimensions:

1. **Capability Readiness** – Technical and architectural maturity, infrastructure flexibility, integration strength.
2. **Organizational Readiness** – Governance, ownership, leadership alignment, and decision velocity.
3. **Behavioral Readiness** – Adaptability, learning agility, and team sentiment toward change.

Each dimension produces a weighted score between 0–1, aggregated into a composite readiness score interpreted by **EAgent** through the ALE (Adaptive Learning Engine).

### 🧮 Report Structure

**Header:**
```
# Organizational Readiness Index – OMS Transformation
Organization: Deckers
Generated: 2025-12-09
Generated by: Fuxi Intelligence Engine (ALE + EAgent)
Readiness Score: 0.64 | Confidence: 0.89 | Stage: Early Integration
```

**Breakdown:**
| Category | Readiness | Risk | Notes |
|-----------|------------|------|-------|
| Integration Infrastructure | 0.75 | Low | MFCS pilot environment validated |
| Data Governance | 0.55 | Medium | Ownership unclear between finance & ops |
| Team Agility | 0.62 | Medium | Parallel workstreams; moderate fatigue |
| Change Enablement | 0.48 | High | No formal change mgmt plan defined |

**EAgent Insight:**
> “The organization shows strong technical readiness but moderate behavioral inertia. Recommend enabling change champion network before OMS cutover.”

### 📊 Methodology

1. **Data Sources**
   - `/data/org_insights/readiness_profiles.json`
   - `/data/telemetry/decision_velocity.json`
   - `/data/sequencer_progress.json`
   - `/data/ale_learning_state.json`

2. **Scoring Logic**
   - Normalize each metric (0–1 scale) from raw telemetry and survey inputs.
   - Apply ALE contextual weighting based on organizational behavior patterns.
   - Compute rolling averages for readiness deltas (ΔR) over time.

3. **Output Files**
   - `/intelligence/reports/org_readiness_index.md`
   - `/intelligence/reports/org_readiness_delta.json`

### 🧩 Integration with D085C

- Extends the **Organizational Intelligence Framework** defined in D085C.
- Shares visualization components, roles, and API structure.
- Provides complementary insights to the **Alignment Index**.
- Enables correlation of *alignment → readiness → outcome* across initiatives.

---

### 🧭 Experience Shell Integration

**Path:** `Intelligence → User Actions → Reports → Organizational Readiness`

**Features:**
- Dynamic visualization of readiness deltas over time.
- Interactive EAgent guidance with contextual prompts:  
  “Readiness has improved 12% since Sequencer phase 2 completion.”
- Capability to simulate readiness impact of planned architectural changes.

---

### 🔄 Roadmap

**Iteration 1:** Implement static JSON → Markdown pipeline for ORI generation (`npm run generate:readiness`).  
**Iteration 2:** Connect telemetry and ALE learning updates.  
**Iteration 3:** Add scenario-based readiness simulations (e.g., tech cutover impact).  
**Iteration 4:** Integrate ORI deltas with ROI/TCC dashboards.

---

### 💹 Companion Summary: Integration with ROI / TCC Dashboards

The ORI directly feeds the **ROI (Return on Investment)** and **TCC (Total Cost of Change)** dashboards within the Experience Shell.

**Integration Logic:**
- **Readiness → ROI Correlation:** Projects with high ORI (>0.75) show faster realization of ROI milestones and reduced cost-overrun variance.
- **Readiness → TCC Correlation:** Low readiness (<0.5) signals elevated transformation friction, increasing TCC by 15–30%.
- **ALE Predictive Modeling:** Uses ORI trends to forecast budget volatility and time-to-value curves.

**Output Pathways:**
- `/intelligence/dashboards/roi_tcc_correlation.json`
- `/intelligence/reports/org_readiness_to_roi.md`

**EAgent Insight Example:**
> “Teams with readiness above 0.7 realized projected ROI six months earlier than expected. Recommend readiness uplift activities before sequencing phase three.”

**Branch:** `feature/d085d_org_readiness_index`  
**Approvers:** Fuxi Core, Agent Z (Bill), Codex  
**Purpose:** Extend the Fuxi Intelligence layer with an actionable measure of transformation readiness — quantifying not just how aligned an organization is, but how *prepared* it truly is to change, and linking that readiness to measurable financial and operational outcomes.
