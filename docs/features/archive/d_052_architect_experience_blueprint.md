# D052: Architect Experience Blueprint

## 1. Emotional Journey: The Human Arc of Discovery

| Phase | Emotional State | Narrative | Product Intent |
|-------|-----------------|------------|----------------|
| **Arrival** | Curious, skeptical | "Another tool? Let's see if this one understands my world." | Build instant trust through simplicity and purpose. |
| **Upload** | Engaged, anticipatory | "It read my files? Wait—it's *understanding* them?" | Deliver fast, visible parsing feedback and immediate recognition of real systems/domains. |
| **Visualization** | Intrigued, analytical | "This is my architecture—alive. I can *see* it." | Animate clarity: living graph, domain boundaries, dependencies breathing into place. |
| **Transformation** | Empowered | "I can model the impact of this change right here." | Sequencer reveals what-if futures in context. |
| **ROI Moment** | Confident, validated | "So *that’s* the math behind our decisions." | Reveal ROI logic transparently: cost, benefit, break-even, domain impact. |
| **Reflection** | Inspired | "I can bring this to leadership—finally something defensible." | Encourage return: shareable brief, learning loop, invitations to team. |

## 2. Functional Flow: From Upload to Understanding

### **Step 1: Upload (App Inventory, Diagram, CSV)**
- Drag-and-drop zone with immediate system/domain recognition.
- Inline assistant: _"Found 38 systems, 7 domains—want me to group them?"_
- Fast parsing summary and preview graph (no empty state).

### **Step 2: Harmonized Graph (Current State)**
- React Flow visualization:
  - Domains as colored clusters.
  - Systems as nodes with disposition hints.
  - Integrations as smooth edges.
- Right-side AI explainer: _"3 systems appear duplicated across domains—possible redundancy."_

### **Step 3: Transformation Sequencer**
- Timeline slider below the graph.
- Systems fade in/out by stage (retain, replace, modernize).
- Cost/benefit estimations appear dynamically.
- AI narrative: _"ERP modernization drives 40% of total benefit by Q4 FY26."_

### **Step 4: ROI Snapshot**
- Minimal chart overlay: cost (left axis), benefit (right axis).
- Hover callouts explain break-even and inflection points.
- Button: **"Explain the math"** expands to reveal the cost function.

### **Step 5: Teach-back Moment**
- Pop-up explainer with animation:
  - "Here’s how ROI was calculated."
  - "Here’s why this decision matters."
  - "Here’s what happens if you delay Stage 2 by 3 months."
- Dynamic what-if control panel: sliders for cost multipliers, risk factors, resource availability.

### **Step 6: Reflection & Share**
- Button: **Generate Transformation Brief**.
  - Auto-builds an executive summary (PDF or live dashboard link).
  - Includes architecture map, ROI curve, and domain insights.
- CTA: _"Invite Finance Partner"_ to validate assumptions.

## 3. UI Wireframe Narrative

### **Layout Structure (ChatGPT-inspired)**
- **Left Rail:** Project Storyline
  - Stages: Intake / Tech Stack / Harmonize / Sequence / ROI
  - Collapsible; breadcrumbs for quick jump.
- **Center Surface:** Adaptive Canvas
  - Living Graph (React Flow) that transitions contextually.
- **Right Panel:** Insight & Action
  - Conversational AI panel explaining what’s on screen.
  - Contextual actions ("Show only cross-domain integrations.")
- **Bottom Bar:** Natural Language Command
  - Example: _"Show me ERP ROI curve"_ or _"Highlight redundant systems."_

## 4. Cognitive "Aha" Moments

| Moment | Trigger | Experience |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Immediate Understanding** | Upload completes | User sees their messy data harmonized into structure. |
| **Visual Recognition** | Graph animates | _"That’s my ecosystem!"_ moment; high trust earned. |
| **Numerical Insight** | ROI snapshot | Seeing math explained visually triggers ownership. |
| **What-if Clarity** | Adjust timeline or cost factor | Confidence replaces uncertainty. |
| **Shareability** | Generates report | Feels authoritative, exportable, real. |

## 5. Teaching ROI: From Guesswork to Literacy

- **Principle:** Teach, don’t hide.
- **Stepwise Reveal:**
  1. Show *visual correlation* (cost vs benefit).
  2. Show *functional drivers* (system types, domains, dependencies).
  3. Show *mathematical logic* (cost = base + effort + impact multipliers).
  4. Offer *simulation control* (risk, overlap, resource delay).
  5. Teach *financial fluency* for architects: _"Now you can explain your decisions in the language of the CFO."_

## 6. Outcome: Why They Come Back

- Feels like a **living companion**, not a dashboard.
- Turns architecture into **a quantified story**.
- Creates **executive confidence** with visual and mathematical integrity.
- Generates **personal mastery** for the architect—they leave smarter than they arrived.

### Next Step
Once this blueprint is validated, we evolve to **multi-user collaborative mode** (CIO, CFO, FP&A, Analyst) in D053—building on this single-user foundation.
