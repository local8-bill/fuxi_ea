## 🧭 Directive D085C – Organizational Intelligence Reports

### 🎯 Objective

Establish a standardized **Organizational Intelligence Reporting Framework** that surfaces behavioral, decision, and alignment data as part of the *Intelligence Branch* within the Experience Shell. This framework allows Fuxi to interpret how organizations behave during transformation and present that learning through narrative, visual, and quantitative insights.

---

### 🧱 Core Concept

Fuxi continuously gathers organizational context — stakeholder alignment, decision consensus, rate of change, sentiment, and execution friction — and transforms it into dynamic reports under the **Intelligence → User Actions → Reports** menu.

Each report synthesizes:
- Behavioral data (stakeholder influence, resistance, collaboration)
- Structural data (architecture decisions, dependencies, system risk)
- Temporal data (sequencing, phasing, learning loops)

These reports become the organization’s **Cognitive Mirror** — showing not only *what* is changing but *how the team thinks* while doing it.

### 🧩 Report 1: Organizational Alignment Index (OMS Transformation)

#### **Context**
Derived from Deckers’ OMS modernization session, including transcripts, stakeholder maps, and decision vectors captured in `/data/org_insights/`.

#### **Purpose**
Show how alignment, friction, and readiness evolve throughout transformation. Identify who drives or slows change and how that influences TCC and ROI trajectories.

#### **Structure**
1. **Executive Summary** – Key findings on consensus, resistance, and transformation trajectory.
2. **Alignment Graph** – Stakeholder alignment index, polarization score, consensus delta.
3. **Decision Influence Summary** – Correlation between architecture choices and social acceptance.
4. **Sentiment Analysis** – Aggregated tone and behavioral signals from transcripts or EAgent input.
5. **EAgent Commentary** – Contextualized recommendations derived from ALE reasoning.
6. **Learning Vector** – Correlation between consensus and decision velocity.

### 📊 Example Report Header

```
Title: Organizational Alignment Index – OMS Transformation
Generated: 2025-12-09
Organization: Deckers
Generated by: Fuxi Intelligence Engine (ALE + EAgent)
Consensus Score: 0.81 | Polarization Index: 0.22 | Dominant Strategy: Incremental Hybrid
```

### 📘 Example Markdown Output

```
## Alignment Summary
Deckers’ transformation organization exhibits strong architectural alignment (Architects + Consultants + Integrators) and moderate execution friction (Finance + Engineering). 

### Stakeholder Consensus
| Stakeholder | Alignment | Influence | Bias |
|--------------|------------|-----------|------|
| Ralph Smith | 0.9 | Simplification | Decoupling |
| Nick Smotek | 0.7 | Pragmatic | Sequencing |
| Jesse Carstens | 0.8 | Integrative | Composability |
| Prasad Tendulkar | 0.6 | Financial | ROI Focus |
| Siva Boothathan | 0.4 | Engineering | Operational Simplicity |

**Overall Alignment:** 0.81  
**Polarization Index:** 0.22  
**Readiness Stage:** Early Adaptive  
```

### 🧮 Report Generation Workflow

1. **Data Sources**  
   - `/data/org_insights/influence_vectors.json`  
   - `/data/org_insights/decision_alignment.json`  
   - `/data/graph/decision_nodes.json`  
   - ALE sentiment corpus & telemetry.

2. **Processing**  
   - Normalize stakeholder vectors → derive consensus metrics.  
   - Compute ALE Correlation (alignment × decision velocity).  
   - Extract narrative cues from EAgent conversation history.  

3. **Report Creation**  
   - `/api/intelligence/report?type=org_alignment`  → returns Markdown.  
   - Saved under `/intelligence/reports/org_alignment_oms.md`.

4. **Experience Shell Integration**  
   - Visible via left-nav → **Intelligence → User Actions → Reports**.  
   - Restricted to `/mode founder` and `/mode advisor`.  
   - Optionally subscribable for automated regeneration after each decision phase.

---

### 🧠 EAgent Behavior

- Narrates organizational patterns: *“Alignment has improved 8% since MFCS-first sequencing.”*  
- Recommends mitigation: *“Engineering resistance remains high; propose phased testing.”*  
- Generates adaptive insights over time using ALE feedback loops.

### 🧰 Storage Structure
```
/data/org_insights/
    ├── influence_vectors.json
    ├── decision_alignment.json
    ├── sentiment_history.json
    └── readiness_profiles.json

    └── org_alignment_oms.md
```

### 🔐 Access Control
| Role | Access | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Founder | Full | Can generate, view, and export reports |
| Advisor | Limited | Can view reports only |
| Analyst | Restricted | Data summaries only |
| General User | None | Behavioral data hidden |

---

### 🧭 Next Steps
1. Implement `/api/intelligence/report` for generating and serving Markdown reports.
2. Create UI integration point in Experience Shell → Intelligence section.
3. Add ALE hooks to update consensus and friction metrics after each Sequencer or ROI phase.
4. Extend this framework to additional report types (Readiness Index, Decision Heatmap, Change Velocity).

**Branch:** `feature/d085c_org_intelligence_reports`  
**Approvers:** Fuxi Core, Agent Z (Bill), Codex  
**Purpose:** Provide an enterprise mirror that lets leaders *see how their organization learns*, not just what it builds.

### 📎 Companion Directive Reference

This directive establishes the foundation for all Intelligence Report types. The first companion directive, **D085D – Organizational Readiness Index**, extends this structure to model execution preparedness, technical maturity, and behavioral readiness within transformation initiatives.
