# 🧭 Fuxi · Enterprise Engine  
## Capability Roadmap & Architecture Evolution

---

### 🌍 Forward

Fuxi is the adaptive core of the modern enterprise — built to help organizations see, reason, and act with clarity.  
Every feature, scene, and telemetry stream feeds into a single intent: **to make complexity navigable**.

This roadmap outlines the evolution from our current Experience Shell to a fully adaptive enterprise ecosystem — one that learns from user behavior, orchestrates insight, and builds a shared digital memory across teams.

---

### 🧱 Phase 1 · Foundation (Now → Launch Readiness)

Goal: Unify, polish, and stabilize the Experience Shell.

- **UXShell v0.3** — finalize left nav, global topbar, and EAgent toggle.
- **Directive cleanup (D060–D071)** — remove legacy routes, align telemetry schema.
- **Experience Templates (D071C)** — reusable shells + tiles for every scene.
- **Telemetry Refinement** — normalize events and trust models.
- **Scene Registry** — one entrypoint for all `/experience?scene=` routes.
- **Testing & Deploy** — Playwright + Vercel pipeline hardening.

✅ *Outcome:* Clean, stable demo environment with unified UX and CI/CD.

---

### 🚀 Phase 2 · Expansion (Q1)

Goal: Move from static mock data to live orchestration.

- **SQLite / Turso integration** — relational persistence for projects, systems, and telemetry.  
- **Behavioral Engine v2** — motivation, focus, and decision confidence metrics.  
- **Dynamic Experience Templates** — scenes configurable from data.  
- **Authentication + Profiles** — multi-user session sync.  
- **EAgent Persona Layer** — tone + focus adapt per user role.

---

### 🧠 Phase 3 · Intelligence (Q2–Q3)

Goal: Bring adaptive reasoning and memory into the engine.

- **Local LLM / Edge Model Integration** — Mistral, Llama, or Phi via Ollama for on-device inference.  
- **EAgent Cognitive Loop** — memory, reinforcement learning, adaptive dialogue.  
- **Scenario Simulation Engine** — what-if modeling on harmonized graphs.  
- **Adaptive Visual Twin** — dynamic overlays for risk, modernization, and ROI.

---

### 🌐 Phase 4 · Enterprise Network (Q4)

Goal: Enable collaboration and distributed intelligence.

- **Teams & Roles** — shared projects with role-based perspectives.  
- **Knowledge Graph Backend** — Neo4j/Memgraph for system + capability linkages.  
- **Change Management Module** — unify tech and organizational transformation.  
- **Insight Orchestration Layer** — EAgent instances collaborate across domains.

---

### 🧬 Phase 5 · Adaptive Enterprise (2026)

Goal: Transform Fuxi into a self-evolving enterprise brain.

- **Predictive Governance** — forecast risk, compliance, and opportunity.  
- **Intent Graph** — map enterprise goals, constraints, and systemic feedback.  
- **Multi-Model Reasoning** — route queries to specialized domain LLMs.  
- **Personalized UX Intelligence** — adaptive interfaces per cognitive profile.
