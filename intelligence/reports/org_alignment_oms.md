# Organizational Alignment Index – OMS Transformation

- **Generated:** 2025-12-09
- **Organization:** Deckers
- **Consensus Score:** 0.81
- **Polarization Index:** 0.22
- **Dominant Strategy:** Incremental Hybrid

## Alignment Summary
Deckers shows strong architectural cohesion between Architects, Integrators, and external advisors. Finance and Engineering continue to flag cost and duplication risk but have gradually increased trust since the MFCS-first decision was recorded.

## Stakeholder Consensus
| Stakeholder | Alignment | Influence | Bias |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|------|
| Ralph Smith | 0.90 | 0.85 | Decoupling |
| Nick Smotek | 0.70 | 0.78 | Sequencing |
| Jesse Carstens | 0.82 | 0.74 | Composable |
| Prasad Tendulkar | 0.60 | 0.68 | ROI |
| Raj Rawat | 0.88 | 0.71 | Centralized Inventory |
| Siva Boothathan | 0.44 | 0.65 | Operational Simplicity |
| Thomas Kelly | 0.95 | 0.80 | Composable Modernization |
| Ben Parker | 0.68 | 0.62 | B2B-first |
| Ronald La Belle | 0.75 | 0.70 | Data Clarity |

## Decision Influence Summary
- **Decouple OMS from MFCS/EBS** – 0.78 alignment, supported by Ralph/Jesse/Thomas, resistance from Siva.
- **Regional rollout (NA first)** – 0.74 alignment, backed by Nick/Ben, Finance watching ROI.
- **Standalone inventory service** – 0.69 alignment, Raj pushing; Engineering/Finance pushing for guardrails.

## Sentiment + Readiness
Recent sentiment improved from cautious to optimistic as architectural guardrails were agreed. Readiness sits at **Early Adaptive** with learning velocity 0.67 and remaining friction at Finance + Engineering.

## Recommendations
1. Keep NA-first plan but expose ROI telemetry for Finance every phase gate.
2. Pair Engineering with Integrations on throwaway-path mitigation.
3. EAgent to monitor stakeholder pulse; trigger alerts when polarization > 0.3.
